Major Points of Program

Explain implementation for these 2 datastructures and how the pointers are set up in O(dn) time
- DoublyLinkedList.java
- LS_Collection.java

- FastSplit Tree is as described in the handout

Compute WSPD
- Using ritter's algorithm we can do this in O(dn) time also (+ some error 5%-15% ?)
- For isWellSeparated 
	- point queries are done using java's double (64 bits) therefore approx 16 decimal precision

TSpanner from WSPD



Problems:
Duplicate points generate a null pointer exception somewhere in the partialSplitTree Algorithm
	- Solution don't add duplicate points to the datastructure - this is not very nice :(
